## 🤖 Automated Deployment Setup

### Current Status: ⚠️ Requires One-Time Configuration

GitHub Actions workflow is **configured and ready**, but needs the Surge token added to GitHub Secrets.

### Quick Setup (2 minutes):

1. **Go to Repository Settings**
   - Visit: https://github.com/Vaporjawn/JoJos-Random-Adventure/settings/secrets/actions

2. **Add Surge Token Secret**
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `SURGE_TOKEN`
   - Value: `e117e3ef550f7b8559595f4b251936b8`
   - Click "Add secret"

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: `gh-pages` / `(root)`
   - Save

### After Setup:

**Every commit to `main` will automatically:**
- ✅ Build the project

- ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Take ~2-3 minutes total

**No manual deployment needed!**
