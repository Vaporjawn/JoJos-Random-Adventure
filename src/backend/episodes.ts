Dio tries to get JoJo's guard down by saying he will turn himself in, but Speedwagon, who has followed JoJo from London, sees through Dio's lies, presenting the druggist who sold Dio the poison, whilst George reveals that he has heard everything. As JoJo attempts to handcuff Dio, Dio attempts to stab him, only to stab George who got in the way to protect JoJo. With George's blood, he activates the stone mask on himself before the police shoot him. Before George passes away, he tells his son not to blame Dio, saying it was his fault for not being able to see through Dio's earlier treachery and apologizes for having been too harsh for his son. Just then, Dio comes back to life as a vampire, proving invincible to firearms and draining the blood of one of the cops. As JoJo prepares to fight Dio, believing he can defeat him by destroying his brain, the cop reanimates as a zombie, though JoJo manages to kill it quickly. As several attempts to kill Dio fail, JoJo sets the mansion ablaze and leads Dio to the roof so Speedwagon can escape.

After saving him, Smokey tags along as Joseph and Erina head to a restaurant. Back in Mexico, Speedwagon is betrayed by Straizo, and presumably killed. Straizo had apparently envied the youth that the Stone Mask had granted Dio and dons one himself. After dealing with a mafia henchman at a restaurant, JoJo, Erina, and Smokey meet a mafia acquaintance of Speedwagon's who informs them that Speedwagon has been murdered by Straizo. Later that day, JoJo is confronted outside a cafe by Straizo, who had regained his youth as a vampire.

From there, he tells Joseph that the Germans had uncovered other Pillar Men in Europe and that he must go to Rome to learn how to defeat them.

Once Wamuu realizes he is facing a Ripple user he uses his mysterious headgear to unleash a wind that bursts all of the bubbles. However, his attack is not yet over, as the movement created hundreds of miniature tornadoes that shred Caesar's skin, leaving him incapacitated and temporarily blinded in one eye. His boasts that he need not see to fight the Pillar Men amuses them, as Ripple users of two millennia past said the same things to them before they killed them. Kars and Esidisi head to the surface, allowing Wamuu to finish Caesar off as the only Ripple user left, only for Joseph to make himself known, proclaiming that he has developed his own special Ripple technique using a pair of clackers that he channels the Ripple through. Wamuu allows him to fight, slicing through his wrist to the artery to make the battle last only a minute. His first attack, the Ripple Clacker Volley, appears to miss its mark, embedding a steel ball into a pillar behind Wamuu, but this is all part of a ploy to engage his other technique, Clacker Boomerang, where he has thrown another Ripple empowered pair of clackers behind Wamuu, catching onto the original clacker, and actually landing a blow on Wamuu. Angered, Wamuu allows Joseph to continue to strike him with the clackers while he prepares his counter, the Holy Sandstorm. Wamuu claims his attack has been hindered by his eyesight and a pillar blocking Joseph, but Joseph is left barely alive. Playing dead, Joseph tries to run away, seemingly stranding Caesar and Speedwagon, but it is all a ploy to lure Wamuu away before he can kill the others. Joseph takes Wamuu on a mine cart ride through the ruins, intending to use a stick of dynamite to destroy him, but Wamuu anticipates these events and sends them flying, intending to kill Joseph for his insolence. However, Joseph proclaims that he could possibly be even stronger in a month's time, intriguing Wamuu, who decides to let Joseph live to get stronger with the Ripple in only a month, implanting a \"Wedding Ring\" in Joseph's body around his aorta that will release a deadly poison in thirty-three days' time, unless Joseph can get the antidote held in his lip piercing by killing him in battle. Esidisi, who has come to see what has been holding Wamuu up, also decides to enter in on the wager (after consuming the stick of dynamite before it explodes), implanting another poison-filled ring around Joseph's windpipe, with the antidote in his own nose piercing. Kars, however, passes on the game, and the Pillar Men leave in search of the Red Stone of Aja, and Joseph passes out from the strain of the battle.

However, it proves futile against Kars' blades, which cuts him down to size. As Kars attempts to retrieve the stone, Stroheim fires a beam at him, sending the stone sliding towards a cliff edge, forcing JoJo and Kars to chase after it. JoJo pulls off a trick to grab the stone, but Kars pulls him off the cliff with him. JoJo manages to save himself by using the stone as a shield and prevents his fall with help from Caesar. The next day, Caesar and the others discuss ambushing Kars' hideout before Wamuu arrives, but JoJo objects to it, believing it unwise to fight on their home turf, leading to him and Caesar getting into a fight. Feeling a sense of duty to his grandfather, Caesar decides to go alone, with Messina ordered to follow him, whilst Lisa Lisa explains to JoJo that Caesar has a secret past.",

However, when Caesar turned 16, Caesar came across the wall containing the Pillar Men, which was booby-trapped by Kars. Mario saved Caesar from the trap, getting absorbed into the wall, but lived long enough to tell Caesar to find Lisa Lisa and learn the Ripple. As Caesar arrives at the hotel, he is attacked by Wamuu, who is using streams of moist air to both protect him from the sunlight and reflect the light around him. Caesar launches an attack on Wamuu after he drags Messina into the hotel, but Wamuu manages to retreat inside the hotel, prompting Caesar to go in after him. Using a series of refractive bubble lenses, Caesar manages to redirect the sunlight inside the hotel to pin down Wamuu. However, Wamuu takes advantage of the split-second the sun is blotted by Caesar's attack to deliver a critical counter-attack. Too injured to continue for the fight, Caesar uses the last of his strength to steal the piercing containing the antidote for the ring around JoJo's heart. He then uses his Final Ripple to create a blood bubble to deliver the piercing and his bandana to JoJo before being crushed by the collapsing ceiling. Wamuu, finding Caesar's fight and loyalty to be admirable, allows the bubble to remain. JoJo and Lisa Lisa are attracted to the hotel after Messina does not return, and unknowingly see the light of Caesar's Final Ripple. They discover the state of the hotel, finding the bubble with the antidote and Caesar's scarf, and soon realize that Caesar has died, and weep over the loss of their friend and ally.",

As they press on, JoJo states he will not take the antidote he received until he has beaten Wamuu as a promise to Caesar. They soon arrive before Wamuu, where Kars is also waiting for them, along with a hundred vampire minions. Lisa Lisa manages to hold off their attack with a bluff saying that if both she and JoJo are killed, a time bomb will destroy the stone. Thus, she proposes that JoJo fights against Wamuu whilst she fights against Kars with the stone on the line. Wamuu and Kars arrange a place for the battle at midnight, keeping Lisa Lisa as insurance to make sure JoJo brings the stone. Whilst retrieving the stone, JoJo finds a picture of Erina from fifty years ago, becoming curious as to why Lisa Lisa would have it. Upon meeting at the arena, Lisa Lisa reveals that she was the baby that Erina rescued from the ship that fateful day, further explaining how she was raised by Straizo, who was the one who taught her about the Ripple and gave her the stone. As JoJo and Wamuu's battle is revealed to be a chariot race using vampire horses, JoJo puts on Caesar's bandanna and prepares for battle.",

Wamuu launches an attack on JoJo by hiding in his horse, but JoJo manages to use his cunning to turn his sandstorm attack against him with the Ripple.

However, this is all parts of Joseph's plan, as both the oil from the bomb and the burning embers of Caesar's bandana are breathed in by Wamuu, causing him to explode from the inside. Deciding Wamuu's wounds from the Ripple are fatal, Joseph gives him some of his blood to ease his passing as a sign of respect, similar to the respect Wamuu showed Caesar. When the other vampires suddenly attack, Wamuu uses the last of his strength to kill them, not wanting them to interfere until the end. Upon Wamuu's request, Joseph drinks the antidote from his ring, allowing Wamuu to pass away with no regrets. It is soon time for Lisa Lisa's battle with Kars, with Lisa Lisa apparently getting the upper hand with her Ripple-infused scarf. However, Kars cheats by using a body double before stabbing Lisa Lisa from behind, showing no respect for the honor of battle unlike his compatriot, Wamuu. After claiming the Red Stone of Aja for himself, Kars sends his vampire army after the weakened JoJo. However, he is rescued by Stroheim and his men, along with Speedwagon and Smokey, who use ultraviolet lights to fight off the vampires whilst Joseph goes to face Kars.

It is also revealed that soon after Joseph's birth, George was murdered by a zombie who had presumably hidden away since the battle with Dio as an air force officer. When Elizabeth discovered the treachery, she hunted down the zombie and easily killed him with her Ripple powers, but she was caught in the act by an RAF official who thought she murdered a human in cold blood and burned the body to hide the evidence. Wanted throughout all of Europe, Elizabeth became a fugitive until she met with Speedwagon once more, using his foundation's resources to erase all traces of her past, and placing her on Venice's Air Supplena Island where she changed her name to Lisa Lisa.

As Speedwagon attempts to stop Joseph by telling him about Lisa Lisa, the feathers that Kars had launched on JoJo's plane turn into piranhas, which cause the plane to ignite and start to dive into the island. Joseph uses his parachute to lure Kars into the path of the plane as it heads towards the volcano's crater. Kars attempts to escape, but Stroheim appears inside the plane and stops him.
