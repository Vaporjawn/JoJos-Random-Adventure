Dio tries to get JoJo's guard down by saying he will turn himself in, but Speedwagon, who has followed JoJo from London, sees through Dio's lies, presenting the druggist who sold Dio the poison, whilst George reveals that he has heard everything. As JoJo attempts to handcuff Dio, Dio attempts to stab him, only to stab George who got in the way to protect JoJo. With George's blood, he activates the stone mask on himself before the police shoot him. Before George passes away, he tells his son not to blame Dio, saying it was his fault for not being able to see through Dio's earlier treachery and apologizes for having been too harsh for his son. Just then, Dio comes back to life as a vampire, proving invincible to firearms and draining the blood of one of the cops. As JoJo prepares to fight Dio, believing he can defeat him by destroying his brain, the cop reanimates as a zombie, though JoJo manages to kill it quickly. As several attempts to kill Dio fail, JoJo sets the mansion ablaze and leads Dio to the roof so Speedwagon can escape.

After saving him, Smokey tags along as Joseph and Erina head to a restaurant. Back in Mexico, Speedwagon is betrayed by Straizo, and presumably killed. Straizo had apparently envied the youth that the Stone Mask had granted Dio and dons one himself. After dealing with a mafia henchman at a restaurant, JoJo, Erina, and Smokey meet a mafia acquaintance of Speedwagon's who informs them that Speedwagon has been murdered by Straizo. Later that day, JoJo is confronted outside a cafe by Straizo, who had regained his youth as a vampire.

From there, he tells Joseph that the Germans had uncovered other Pillar Men in Europe and that he must go to Rome to learn how to defeat them.

Once Wamuu realizes he is facing a Ripple user he uses his mysterious headgear to unleash a wind that bursts all of the bubbles. However, his attack is not yet over, as the movement created hundreds of miniature tornadoes that shred Caesar's skin, leaving him incapacitated and temporarily blinded in one eye. His boasts that he need not see to fight the Pillar Men amuses them, as Ripple users of two millennia past said the same things to them before they killed them. Kars and Esidisi head to the surface, allowing Wamuu to finish Caesar off as the only Ripple user left, only for Joseph to make himself known, proclaiming that he has developed his own special Ripple technique using a pair of clackers that he channels the Ripple through. Wamuu allows him to fight, slicing through his wrist to the artery to make the battle last only a minute. His first attack, the Ripple Clacker Volley, appears to miss its mark, embedding a steel ball into a pillar behind Wamuu, but this is all part of a ploy to engage his other technique, Clacker Boomerang, where he has thrown another Ripple empowered pair of clackers behind Wamuu, catching onto the original clacker, and actually landing a blow on Wamuu. Angered, Wamuu allows Joseph to continue to strike him with the clackers while he prepares his counter, the Holy Sandstorm. Wamuu claims his attack has been hindered by his eyesight and a pillar blocking Joseph, but Joseph is left barely alive. Playing dead, Joseph tries to run away, seemingly stranding Caesar and Speedwagon, but it is all a ploy to lure Wamuu away before he can kill the others. Joseph takes Wamuu on a mine cart ride through the ruins, intending to use a stick of dynamite to destroy him, but Wamuu anticipates these events and sends them flying, intending to kill Joseph for his insolence. However, Joseph proclaims that he could possibly be even stronger in a month's time, intriguing Wamuu, who decides to let Joseph live to get stronger with the Ripple in only a month, implanting a \"Wedding Ring\" in Joseph's body around his aorta that will release a deadly poison in thirty-three days' time, unless Joseph can get the antidote held in his lip piercing by killing him in battle. Esidisi, who has come to see what has been holding Wamuu up, also decides to enter in on the wager (after consuming the stick of dynamite before it explodes), implanting another poison-filled ring around Joseph's windpipe, with the antidote in his own nose piercing. Kars, however, passes on the game, and the Pillar Men leave in search of the Red Stone of Aja, and Joseph passes out from the strain of the battle.

However, when Caesar turned 16, Caesar came across the wall containing the Pillar Men, which was booby-trapped by Kars. Mario saved Caesar from the trap, getting absorbed into the wall, but lived long enough to tell Caesar to find Lisa Lisa and learn the Ripple. As Caesar arrives at the hotel, he is attacked by Wamuu, who is using streams of moist air to both protect him from the sunlight and reflect the light around him. Caesar launches an attack on Wamuu after he drags Messina into the hotel, but Wamuu manages to retreat inside the hotel, prompting Caesar to go in after him. Using a series of refractive bubble lenses, Caesar manages to redirect the sunlight inside the hotel to pin down Wamuu. However, Wamuu takes advantage of the split-second the sun is blotted by Caesar's attack to deliver a critical counter-attack. Too injured to continue for the fight, Caesar uses the last of his strength to steal the piercing containing the antidote for the ring around JoJo's heart. He then uses his Final Ripple to create a blood bubble to deliver the piercing and his bandana to JoJo before being crushed by the collapsing ceiling. Wamuu, finding Caesar's fight and loyalty to be admirable, allows the bubble to remain. JoJo and Lisa Lisa are attracted to the hotel after Messina does not return, and unknowingly see the light of Caesar's Final Ripple. They discover the state of the hotel, finding the bubble with the antidote and Caesar's scarf, and soon realize that Caesar has died, and weep over the loss of their friend and ally.",

However, just as the doll drops the hairdryer, Polnareff reveals he was purposely scattering the shards of the bedroom mirror to let himself see above the bed, as Chariot skewers both the hairdryer and the doll's head. Chariot slices Ebony Devil to pieces. The scene cuts to Devo hiding in the bathroom, now a mangled corpse due to his Stand being destroyed. Polnareff then joins up with the others, and Joseph reveals Hermit Purple can create spirit photos using TVs instead of Polaroids if he so desires, though it will be in the format of jumbling audio across channels into words. Joseph gathers through the audio that Kakyoin is a traitor, but DIO appears in the screen and blows up the television Joseph and Avdol are trying to use. Joseph concludes there must be something more to the story, and the episode ends with a cut showing Kakyoin with Jotaro outside the hotel, the former with a menacing look on his face.",

Kakyoin attempts to pay the cashier when a man suddenly snatches his wallet. Kakyoin uses his Stand, Hierophant Green, to trip the snatch thief. With a crazed expression, he proceeds to break the thief's nose and torture him by repeatedly breaking his back nonstop. Jotaro stops Kakyoin from doing so and becomes suspicious of Kakyoin. Kakyoin explains that he was just exhausted from the trip so he was in a bad mood. Jotaro however thinks he was enjoying it. Jotaro informs Kakyoin that the group will be leaving for India tomorrow so he plans on taking a cable car to Singapore Station to reserve tickets. Kakyoin notices four rhinoceros beetles on a tree nearby. Anne calls Kakyoin and sees a rhinoceros beetle's leg in his mouth. He proceeds to swallow it and appears to expand in size. Anne runs towards Jotaro out of fear towards Kakyoin's bizarre attitude. At the cable car station, Kakyoin asks for the cherry on Jotaro's ice cream and attempts to push him over the rail guard. Jotaro manages to save himself and pull himself up as Kakyoin states that he was just kidding and proceeds to play with the cherry on his tongue. Jotaro punches Kakyoin in the jaw when Kakyoin's jaw unexpectedly dislocates and is launched into the cable car. Kakyoin refutes Jotaro's statement by saying that he's not actually possessed rather he is a completely different person as Jotaro immediately realizes. The impostor reveals that he has been growing in size. After Jotaro boards the cable car, the impostor reveals that he has a Stand that combines with whatever flesh that he consumes and even normal people can see and touch the Stand, which goes by the name of Yellow Temperance after the Tarot card Temperance. Jotaro tries to use his Stand, Star Platinum, to attack the Stand user but ends up having his arm burnt by Yellow Temperance. As Anne calls Joseph Joestar to inform him of the current situation, Jotaro jumps out out of the cable car to escape from the Stand user. He tries to burn off the blob but ends up making it spread across his hand. He jumps onto and enters another cable car in an futile attempt to cool down the blob with a boy's ice pop but ends up making the blob dig deeper into his hand. A woman on the same cable car tells him that fire and ice don't work on it and consumes a puppy as she reveals herself to be the Stand user in disguise. The Stand user tells Jotaro that Yellow Temperance is nigh invincible but Jotaro reverts to a secret Joestar technique, running away, as he uses his Stand, Star Platinum, to punch a hole in the cable car and jump down along with the Stand user. As the Stand user lands in water with Jotaro, he opens his Stand's guard to allow himself to breathe. Jotaro finally manages to attack the Stand user and interrogates him about the remaining Stand users coming to assassinate them. He also reveals the identity of a Stand user by the name of J. Geil, a man with two right hands, with a Stand named after The Hanged Man Tarot card, the same man who killed Jean Pierre Polnareff's sister. He explains that J. Geil's abilities revolve around mirrors. The Stand user spots an opportunity to disable Jotaro by transporting his Stand through a manhole into a drainage pipe and catches him. Jotaro states that the Stand user was only lucky until that point and manages to counter it by using Star Platinum to punch the drain and increase water pressure which was enough to break the manhole open and send him flying back into the water. The Stand user begs for mercy but Jotaro responds by saying he's too pathetic to talk to anymore and proceeds to finish him off with a barrage of punches by Star Platinum. The Joestar group is now seen on a train to India. Polnareff now knows the identity of the man with two right hands, J.Geil. Avdol informs the group that Anne has left the group to try and find her father back in Singapore. Although doubtful of her purpose, Polnareff states that he'll miss her.",

Avdol assures them that it is a nice country and all these stories are false. Polnareff goes to the bathroom and is given a stick to use. Confused as to why he would need one, he finds a pig sticking its head out of the toilet. One of the employees informs Polnareff that the bathroom was built with a pig sty right underneath it. Disgusted, Polnareff decides to hold it until they get to the hotel. As he washes his hands, Polnareff looks into the mirror and is surprised by a Stand with two right hands that he can only see in the mirror. Determined to avenge his sister, killed by the user of this Stand, Polnareff breaks the mirror and searches for the Stand user among the crowd. Jean Pierre Polnareff decides to separate from the group in order to find his sister's killer. Muhammad Avdol tries to stop him, sure that separating Polnareff from them is part of a trap. Polnareff accuses him of being a coward for running away from DIO, and a fight almost starts between them before Joseph Joestar stops Avdol's punch, telling him that Polnareff has made his own decision. Meanwhile, a cowboy named Hol Horse and his lover Nena are seen riding an elephant. Nena begs him to marry her, but Hol Horse tells her she shouldn't think about this since she is only 16 and is from a good family. He denies her request, saying he's a traveler destined to die on the streets, and he won't marry her because he loves her too much to make her suffer. He asks her to get off the elephant because he's going to see a friend., who is revealed to be J. Geil, the man with two right hands and the user of the Hanged Man. Hol Horse tells him that he's just using Nena because she's a woman who would do anything for her love. Before they are able to discuss their plans, a snake attacks J. Geil. Combining their Stands Emperor and Hanged Man, the duo completely mutilate the snake. Later, as Polnareff searches for a lead, he sees the two Stand users slowly approaching him. Even though Jean Pierre Polnareff just saw Hol Horse and J. Geil approaching him, J. Geil suddenly vanishes from his view. The one left, Hol Horse, introduces himself and tells Polnareff how \"the gun is mightier than the sword\". Polnareff asks him about J. Geil, but the cowboy still insists how his Stand-shaped gun Emperor is stronger than Silver Chariot's sword. The french Stand user makes fun of this comparison by falsely mishearing his line, which makes Hol Horse laugh with him. Suddenly the cowboy summons his Stand Emperor and shoots Polnareff. To intercept the bullet fast enough, Silver Chariot takes off his armor, but the bullet avoids the sword by itself and goes to strike Polnareff. Muhammad Avdol appears just in time and saves Polnareff, but the bullet changes directions again to hit him instead. As Avdol summons Magician's Red to burn the bullet, he is stabbed by Hanged Man, only seen in the reflection of a puddle behind Avdol, and hit in the head by Emperor's bullet. Noriaki Kakyoin arrives just in time to see Avdol's demise and a crying Polnareff.",

Jean Pierre Polnareff approaches Hol Horse, but is warned by Kakyoin that this was something Avdol was against. Even though he's reluctant, Polnareff agrees to get away with Kakyoin in a nearby truck, but he sees Hanged Man inside another mirror. The Stand taunts Polnareff by telling him that he will soon join Avdol and Sherry in hell. Kakyoin jumps into the jeep, pulls Polnareff in and drives away, out of Emperor's range. J. Geil decides to go after the heroes. Polnareff tells Kakyoin he finally understands what Avdol was trying to tell him, and Kakyoin elbows him in the face in place of a handshake. He then tells Polnareff that now they are going to fight together. In the jeep, Kakyoin and Polnareff discuss how they can defeat Hanged Man and whether a world in the mirror really exists. In the middle of their conversation Kakyoin notices Hanged Man inside a metal part of the steering wheel. He hits the brakes to avoid the Stand, and the jeep flips over. At that moment Polnareff sees Hanged Man jumping from one reflective surface to another. Now that they know how Hanged Man works, they try to hide from all reflective surfaces. A boy trying to sell medicine approaches them, unaware that Hanged Man has moved into his eye. The Stand challenges them to cut the child's eye out, but Polnareff kicks sand into his eyes instead, forcing Hanged Man to move into the only reflective view available: Polnareff's eye. Since he can now predict Hanged Man's trajectory, Polnareff easily cuts the Stand before it manages to enter his eye. They hear J. Geil screaming at a distance and swear to avenge both Muhammad Avdol and Sherry Polnareff. Noriaki Kakyoin and Jean Pierre Polnareff find a man whom they assume to be J. Geil, but Kakyoin notes that this man has a right and left hand. J. Geil draws a crowd around them by claiming that Polnareff and Kakyoin want to give money to everyone. With so many people's eyes to travel between, Hanged Man's path becomes too unpredictable for them to hit the Stand. Kakyoin throws a coin into the air, making everyone look at it and leaving only one reflective surface for Hanged Man to travel to. Polnareff kicks sand into the eye Hanged Man is in currently, forcing the Stand to move to the coin, and slashes its path. J. Geil is incapacitated, and Polnareff attacks him personally with Silver Chariot, leaving holes all over his body. The body is thrown into the air and lands on a fence, hanging upside down. Hol Horse finally catches up to Polnareff and Kakyoin, confident that they are ignoring him out of fear. After Hol Horse insists on fighting them and starts shooting at glass with Emperor to help Hanged Man's attack, Polnareff tells him that J. Geil is already dead and his body a short distance from them. As Polnareff prepares to fight him, Hol Horse runs away under the pretext of checking his partner's body, but is stopped in his tracks by Jotaro Kujo and Joseph Joestar, who have just arrived after burying Muhammad Avdol. Surrounded on all sides, Hol Horse watches helpless as Polnareff sentences him to death and goes for the killing blow, but he is stopped by Nena, allowing Hol Horse to escape. Polnareff tries to run after him even though the woman continues to hold his leg, and, in the confusion, gets her hurt to the point of bleeding as he tries to drag her along the ground. The group leaves, unaware that a drop of Nena's blood has fallen on Joseph's arm. A talking wart grows from it, and eats a fly when it comes near.

Cameo grants Polnareff three wishes, with Polnareff being skeptical until a wish for money causes a treasure chest full of gold coins to appear. Wondering if his wishes can bring people back from the dead, Polnareff wishes that his sister Cherie and Avdol were brought back to life. Cherie seems to be revived, only for her to viciously attack Polnareff to consume his flesh. As Cameo explains, he is actually the Stand Judgement, who can create zombie-like creatures from the earth based on the wisher's desires. Polnareff, terrified, tries to use his final wish to wish Cherie away. However, Cameo tells Polnareff he had already used his third wish: to revive Avdol.",

Realizing Iggy can detect N'Doul's attack, Jotaro coerces him into summoning The Fool, which he discovers can glide. Jotaro hitches a ride against Iggy's wishes so they can head towards N'Doul to stop him from attacking. As they get closer, both Iggy's stubbornness and N'Doul's cunning puts Jotaro at risk, but Jotaro manages to overcome this by using Star Platinum to grab Iggy and throw him in N'Doul's direction. This forces Iggy to protect himself with his Stand while it also manages to distract N'Doul long enough for Jotaro to get behind him and knock him out. Although Jotaro's attack is not fatal, N'Doul commits suicide through the use of Geb so he cannot be interrogated over DIO's plans. Before his death, N'Doul reveals that his Stand is Geb, after the Egyptian god, and he is only one of nine such Stand users, a fact that shocks Jotaro.

The next day, Jotaro calls on Josuke, Okuyasu, and Koichi to inform them that Joseph, whose Hermit Purple Stand can potentially detect Chili Pepper's user, is due to arrive at the port. Just then, Chili Pepper appears from Okuyasu's motorcycle's battery, having heard the whole conversation. He uses the motorcycle to escape to the port, but Okuyasu manages to stop him with The Hand's ability to cut through space-time. Chili Pepper is severely weakened but manages to trick Okuyasu into attacking him once more, revealing an underground electrical cable that makes him stronger. He attacks, severing Okuyasu's arm in the process, and drags the rest of his body into the cable. Luckily, Josuke manages to use Crazy Diamond on Okuyasu's arm, which takes his body away from Chili Pepper before he can be killed and heals him, before Josuke and Jotaro head to the port to save Joseph from the ambush.",

Having hooked Mista by the hand and Beach Boy's line being unbreakable as well as able to reflect energy into the catch, Pesci seems to have the advantage and tries to reel Mista in, making the hook draw closer to the gunman's heart. Nonetheless, Mista turns the table on his foe by firing Sex Pistols and destroying his ice, making Pesci panic and unsummon Beach Boy. Mista confronts Pesci and almost shoots him but Prosciutto, disguised as an old man, takes Mista's hand and disables him. Lecturing Pesci again on his team's fighting spirit, Prosciutto shoots Mista in the head and goes back to the cabin. Prosciutto and Pesci eventually find the turtle but are attacked by Bucciarati, as Mista has survived thanks to Sex Pistols and informed his leader of the situation. However, Bucciarati's fight exhausts him and the aging effect takes hold, forcing the capo to throw himself out of the express train with Prosciutto and hopefully take him out.",

Diavolo enhances the ploy by deducing that Bucciarati is now a corpse who can only see spirits and emitting a bit of his own soul - Bucciarati is fooled into thinking Doppio is Trish. The two enter the Colosseum where they are confronted by Polnareff from the second floor. Polnareff eventually sees Doppio as a suspicious person, and both him and Diavolo remember Polnareff's attempt to investigate the Arrows in Italy only to be nearly killed by Diavolo in person. Polnareff forces Diavolo's hand, forcing the Boss to come out and confront him. Diavolo gets the better of Polnareff a second time, and Polnareff is forced to pierce Silver Chariot with the Arrow in front of Diavolo to protect it. Diavolo kills Polnareff and takes the Arrow. Looking down on the first floor, he sees Team Bucciarati coming to their leader and plans to kill them, but he then sees a new Stand in front of him.",
