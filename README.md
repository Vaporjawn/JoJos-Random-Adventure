To set up the project:

```bash
yarn 
npm install
```

Starts the development server.

```bash
 yarn start
```

Bundles the app into static files for production.

```bash
  yarn build
```

Starts the test runner.

```bash
  yarn test
```

 Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

```bash
  yarn eject
```

I suggest that you begin by typing:

```bash
  cd app
  npm install
  yarn start
```

Happy hacking! :)
